The "Computer Vision Based Attendance Marking System" introduces a transformative approach to attendance tracking through the integration of sophisticated facial recognition technology. By leveraging a webcam to capture live video feed, the system employs advanced algorithms to accurately identify individuals in real-time. This streamlined process eliminates the need for manual attendance marking, reducing errors and improving efficiency. Users register by providing their unique identification (ID) and name, along with facial images for authentication. Once registered, individuals can effortlessly mark their attendance by appearing in front of the camera. The system automatically detects their faces, matches them with the registered database, and records their attendance, including the date and time. Password protection ensures secure access, while a centralized database maintains comprehensive attendance records for easy management and retrieval. Developed using Python, Tkinter, OpenCV, and Pandas, the system offers a user-friendly interface suitable for various sectors, including educational institutions and corporate environments. With its intuitive design and seamless integration, the system promises to enhance productivity and streamline attendance management processes.
